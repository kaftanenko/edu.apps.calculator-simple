# Simple Calculator Apps

The project demonstrates some technologies on example of a **Simple Calculator App**:

* [service](./service): API and an implementation of a Simple Calculator Service

Currently implemented are the following standalone apps: 

* [app.calculator.access.ui.web.jsf](./access/access.ui.web.jsf): Web-App based on the JSF technology
* [app.calculator.access.ui.web.jsp](./access/access.ui.web.jsp): Web-App based on the JSP technology

Further implementations based on some other technologies will hopefully follow.
